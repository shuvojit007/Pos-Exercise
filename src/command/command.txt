Command is a behavioral design pattern that turns a request into a stand-alone object
that contains all information about the request.

Pros of Command Pattern

 Single Responsibility Principle. You can decouple classes that invoke operations from classes that perform these operations.
 Open/Closed Principle. You can introduce new commands into the app without breaking existing client code.
 You can implement undo/redo.
 You can implement deferred execution of operations.
 You can assemble a set of simple commands into a complex one.

Cons of Command Pattern

 The code may become more complicated since youâ€™re introducing a whole new layer between senders and receivers.
